# Twitter Clone

First of all, this project was created for demonstration purposes. I did not try to create a working copy of Twitter and this project will never be hosted.

Some functionalities could be implemented using alternative ways, like searching (we could be using ElasticSearch linked to our MongoDB instance).
I didn't develop ALL Twitter features (polls, DMs, ...) and we cannot attached files to our tweets, because for this kind of website, I recommand using CDN, which is quite overkill for such project.

## Getting into it
You'll find more details on how to live preview and test this project in the respective README you can find in the two main folders.
