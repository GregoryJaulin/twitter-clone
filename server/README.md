### Properties
Check out the `.env` file which contain many informations and defaults values that you can override to fit your installation.

### Start server
To start the server, just run `npm run start`.

### Requirements
Before getting into live server, you'll need to start MongoDB instance.

⚠️ Note that in production, we recommand using a securized MongoDB instance. For this project I didn't bother me with that, but it's really important to keep your data safe
